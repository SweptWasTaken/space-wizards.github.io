	<p>So when was the last progress report made? November right?</p>
<p>Oh jeez.</p>
<p>So depending on whether or not you read our Discord, you either think SS14 is dead or <em>Waiting for Godot</em>. Luckily (?), we&rsquo;re the latter!</p>
<h2 id="godot">Godot</h2>
<p>You may have heard of this open source game engine called <a href="https://godotengine.org/"><em>Godot</em></a> semi-recently. It&rsquo;s a 100% free and open source engine that&rsquo;s got quite a lot going for itself. Until recently they&rsquo;ve been on 2.1, and while the engine was quite capable for 2D games (so I&rsquo;ve heard) it was poorly documented, quite clunky and the 3D support was poor at best.</p>
<p>So their community of developers has been hard at work to make Godot 3, which improves the engine a <em>ton</em>. Actually I&rsquo;m pretty sure <em>ton</em> doesn&rsquo;t do it justice. Personally I first heard about the engine at all 6 months ago, due to this video:</p>
<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XptlVErsL-o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Just a month ago, <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-3-0-released">Godot 3.0 left beta</a>.</p>
<p>One really big feature (of many) in Godot 3 is support for C# through Mono. If you didn&rsquo;t know what the Waiting for Godot memes were yet, you can see where this is going.</p>
<h2 id="waiting-for-godot">Waiting for Godot.</h2>
<p>So due to our decision to support 3D and 2D in SS13, we obviously would&rsquo;ve needed to write our own OpenGL 3D renderer. This is of course very difficult and only Silver seemed to even have remotely the knowledge to do it. Hell Acruid wrote a textbook example 3D renderer and <a href="/images/post/18_02_26-mike-macos.png">it didn&rsquo;t work correctly on my iMac</a> (I blame Apple for this).</p>
<p>So then when that certain video caught my eye claiming Mono support, oh boy.</p>
<p>At the very end of October, Godot 3 Alpha 2 was released with experimental C# support. At the beginning of December I started the <code>godot</code> branch on GitHub to get the client running in Godot. I was debating how much we wanted to use Godot before this, but settled on using it for rendering, audio, input and GUI (Godot has an excellent GUI system).</p>
<p>3 months later, and we&rsquo;re still waiting. Personally that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been quite busy due to IRL reasons recently. There is very little work left before we can finally kill the SFML branch at this point. Really I just need to set up automatic builds and fix the content hands GUI.</p>
<p>But hey let&rsquo;s talk about the progress on the Godot branch!</p>
<p><img src="/images/post/18_02_26-godot_screenshot_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see: it works.</p>
<p>We are currently using Godot&rsquo;s own GUI system. It&rsquo;s completely wrapped using tons of code, but it&rsquo;s one hell of a lot better than maintaining the old hacky GUI system. Screenshot!</p>
<p><img src="/images/post/18_02_26-godot_screenshot_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t made any efforts to theme the GUI system much yet, so it&rsquo;s mostly Godot&rsquo;s own default GUI theme. Still better than the old mess:</p>
<p><img src="/images/post/18_02_26-not-godot-screenshot.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Performance is much better than the SFML branch too. Though uh&hellip; on macOS it&rsquo;s still <em>highly</em> lacking when lights are involved. This seems to be completely the fault of Apple&rsquo;s ancient awful OpenGL drivers. Godot 3 uses GLES3.0 for rendering (although a GLES2.0 renderer is coming in Godot 3.1 to solve this, especially due to Android). Apple&rsquo;s best supported OpenGL version is 4.1 (and it&rsquo;s poor support at that), which is 8 years old now. It&rsquo;s even worse in 3D, where Godot pretty much seems to choke the GPU and make the entire system slow from just rendering a single cube. Thanks Apple.</p>
<p>(Side note: just a few hours before writing this, <a href="https://www.khronos.org/news/press/vulkan-applications-enabled-on-apple-platforms">Vulkan now runs on macOS thanks to MoltenVK being open sourced</a>, and Godot&rsquo;s renderer seems to be getting rewritten to Vulkan. There is hope for playing 2/3D spessmens on macOS.)</p>
<p>Also, I spent a few hours working with Godot&rsquo;s 3D system to try importing the models from SS3D into Godot, and once I had a clue what I was doing I managed to get it at least imported at a basic level. <em>this isn&rsquo;t SS14 it&rsquo;s just a test project, there&rsquo;s no code for 3D in SS14 yet</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/post/18_02_26-godot_screenshot_3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So yes. Godot is promising!</p>
<h2 id="power-to-the-refactors">Power to the refactors</h2>
<p>So did Godot mean everything was put on hold and SS14 is dead? Nope! I&rsquo;ve been working on Godot in a separate branch, so Acruid and Cluster continued of working on the rest of the game.</p>
<p>Cluster did a lot of work on the content repo. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14-content/pull/25">power network system with supply and demand.</a> There&rsquo;s no way to correctly visualize this yet, but that&rsquo;s to come. There&rsquo;s also an <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14-content/pull/26">interaction system</a>, and clicking wires with wirecutters is a simple interaction example that works. Woo!</p>
<p>Acruid has been working more engine-side. There&rsquo;s now a proper <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/522">transform parenting system</a>! This works pretty much the same as in say Unity or Godot, where an entity&rsquo;s position is relative to the position of its parent. Practical examples of this would be making a shuttle&rsquo;s grid an entity. This makes all entities parented to it be implicitly moved when the shuttle does, with little hassle or bugs.</p>
<center><video src="/video/18_02_28-spinner.mp4" controls height=300></video></center>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t stop there! We have <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/523">mostly-fully fledged map saving</a>! It supports both saving an entire map (think of a map as a z-level in SS13), or storing individual grids of the map (station itself, the shuttle, etc&hellip;).</p>
<h2 id="new-logo">New logo</h2>
<p>So a while ago, we contacted Supernorn (the artist of the original Space Station 13 Remake project before it got open sourced) about the game&rsquo;s logo source, and he gave us the original vector source files for it. Thanks! We applied duct tape for hilarity&rsquo;s sake, and currently it looks like this in-game:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old_logo.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Injazz decided to bust out Inkscape and change the logo up. The colour is actually the blue from the Godot logo! (Remie&rsquo;s idea), Here&rsquo;s the new design:</p>
